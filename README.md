# Practical-C-Programming
This is a repo of worked problems that I've worked through from the book Practical C Programming.
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-c-programming/1565923065/

Topics include basics, file creation, makefiles, data structures and recursion. 

I am using the VSCode IDE and GNU's C tools (gcc,mingw,etc).
